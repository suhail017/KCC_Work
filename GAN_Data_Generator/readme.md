# Codebase for creating the synthetic data using GAN generator.
We are developing the synthetic data from the [NEXRAD](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/docs/nexrad_mosaic/) radar mosaic to train Detection and localization models using Matlab. The code base is in Matlab and the customize output is 128 by 128 image. We are using aws based GPU platform for the development.
